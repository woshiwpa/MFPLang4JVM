			MFP programming language can be used to develop small games. Nevertheless, MFP cannot build very big and sophisticated action games or any 3D game since it is not designed to build game and it is still a developing language. However, MFP's advantage is its cross-platform capability. Using identifical MFP script, an MFP game can run on any computer with JAVA installed and any Android device with Scientific Calculator Plus installed. Moreover, developer can pack an MFP game program into an APK and publish this APK in any Andoird App distribution website.

			This tutorial demonstrates developer to code up animation, process player's inputs and use auxiliary sound and image files. Also, several game examples are provided.

		<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
			Developer may also take advantage of MFP's parallel computing feature and build multi-device and multi-player games, i.e. chess or multi-device hungry snake. This tutorial provides a multi-device hungry snake as an example.
