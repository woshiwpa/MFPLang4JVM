		<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
			<i>MFP</i> programming language is a scripting tool to solve sophisticated problems by taking most advantage of today's hardware capability. <i>MFP</i> means Mathematical language For Parallel computing. With built-in support to object oriented programming, basic mathematic calculations (i.e. matrix, complex, etc.) and parallel computation, <i>MFP</i> targets at scientific researchers, engineers and software developers.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
			The design of <i>MFP</i> is platform independent. However, limited by resource, at this moment <i>MFP</i> can only run on JVM and Android. <i>MFP</i> on JVM has been open-sourced. Its source codes can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/woshiwpa/MFPLang4JVM" target="_self">https://github.com/woshiwpa/MFPLang4JVM</a>. <i>MFP</i> on Android is an App named <i>Scientific Calculator Plus</i>, which is available in Google Play at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyzapps.AnMath" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyzapps.AnMath</a>. <i>Scientific Calculator Plus</i> includes a full set of manual files which cover both <i>MFP</i> language and use of this App. This webpage also links to manual files of <i>Scientific Calculator Plus</i>.

			<i>MFP</i> language is still under development. It is evolving everyday. Two tasks on the radar are:
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
			1. Implementing JIT compiler to improve its performance;
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
			2. Interoperation between <i>MFP</i> and JAVA.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana;color:black;">
			Besides, a few tasks are on-going and some exciting new features of <i>MFP</i> and/or <i>Scientific Calculator Plus</i> will be exposed in new future. <a href="mailto:cyzsoft@gmail.com">Tony Cui</a>, the creator, designer and developer of <i>MFP</i> and <i>Scientific Calculator Plus</i> welcomes everyone interested in this new language to join the project and help <i>MFP</i> grow up.
